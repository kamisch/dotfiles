# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Guidance

* Ignore GEMINI.md and GEMINI-*.md files
* To save main context space, for code searches, inspections, troubleshooting or analysis, use code-searcher subagent where appropriate - giving the subagent full context background for the task(s) you assign it.
* After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
* For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
* Before you finish, please verify your solution
* Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
* NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
* ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
* NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
* When generating specs for a coding task always think of maximize reuse of existing code and libraries, reducing code volume, keep things clean and extensible.

## Context Files

Each project you work on should always have a /docs subfolder. In the docs subfolder there should contain useful references. To keep the main memory file as slim as possible try extracting out completed tasks, patterns, contexts into docs subfolder. Use the docs/ folder to store your knowledge. You can use markdown’s checkboxes [ ] to keep track of what’s done and what’s not.

## ALWAYS START WITH THESE COMMANDS FOR COMMON TASKS

**Task: "List/summarize all files and directories"**

```bash
fd . -t f           # Lists ALL files recursively (FASTEST)
# OR
rg --files          # Lists files (respects .gitignore)
```

**Task: "Search for content in files"**

```bash
rg "search_term"    # Search everywhere (FASTEST)
```

**Task: "Find files by name"**

```bash
fd "filename"       # Find by name pattern (FASTEST)
```

### Directory/File Exploration

```bash
# FIRST CHOICE - List all files/dirs recursively:
fd . -t f           # All files (fastest)
fd . -t d           # All directories
rg --files          # All files (respects .gitignore)

# For current directory only:
ls -la              # OK for single directory view
```

### BANNED - Never Use These Slow Tools

* ❌ `tree` - NOT INSTALLED, use `fd` instead
* ❌ `find` - use `fd` or `rg --files`
* ❌ `grep` or `grep -r` - use `rg` instead
* ❌ `ls -R` - use `rg --files` or `fd`
* ❌ `cat file | grep` - use `rg pattern file`

### Use These Faster Tools Instead

```bash
# ripgrep (rg) - content search 
rg "search_term"                # Search in all files
rg -i "case_insensitive"        # Case-insensitive
rg "pattern" -t py              # Only Python files
rg "pattern" -g "*.md"          # Only Markdown
rg -1 "pattern"                 # Filenames with matches
rg -c "pattern"                 # Count matches per file
rg -n "pattern"                 # Show line numbers 
rg -A 3 -B 3 "error"            # Context lines
rg " (TODO| FIXME | HACK)"      # Multiple patterns

# ripgrep (rg) - file listing 
rg --files                      # List files (respects •gitignore)
rg --files | rg "pattern"       # Find files by name 
rg --files -t md                # Only Markdown files 

# fd - file finding 
fd -e js                        # All •js files (fast find) 
fd -x command {}                # Exec per-file 
fd -e md -x ls -la {}           # Example with ls 

# jq - JSON processing 
jq. data.json                   # Pretty-print 
jq -r .name file.json           # Extract field 
jq '.id = 0' x.json             # Modify field
```

### Search Strategy

1. Start broad, then narrow: `rg "partial" | rg "specific"`
2. Filter by type early: `rg -t python "def function_name"`
3. Batch patterns: `rg "(pattern1|pattern2|pattern3)"`
4. Limit scope: `rg "pattern" src/`

### INSTANT DECISION TREE

```
User asks to "list/show/summarize/explore files"?
  → USE: fd . -t f  (fastest, shows all files)
  → OR: rg --files  (respects .gitignore)

User asks to "search/grep/find text content"?
  → USE: rg "pattern"  (NOT grep!)

User asks to "find file/directory by name"?
  → USE: fd "name"  (NOT find!)

User asks for "directory structure/tree"?
  → USE: fd . -t d  (directories) + fd . -t f  (files)
  → NEVER: tree (not installed!)

Need just current directory?
  → USE: ls -la  (OK for single dir)
```

## Clean Code
- Always keep the code volume as low as possible. ONLY write core functionalities as specified.
- Follow SOLID, KISS and DRY coding practices.

## Plan
When planning a complex task
- Spec docs should live under docs/specs/*
